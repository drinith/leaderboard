 meteor run android-device


 99% of Windows issues with Meteor are caused by anti-virus slowing down file operations, as there are A LOT of files involved in node apps.

Iâ€™ve added exclusions to Windows Defender for

node.exe
7z.exe
choco.exe
and the meteor folder at C:\Users%USERNAME%\AppData\Local.meteor\
This speeds up installs, updates, and builds by about 500%
